Follow [these steps (detailed explanation)](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH14369) to open SJgrabber.\r\n\r\n### Why are there 2 executables (windows)?\r\nOne has the right icon (`Start SJgrabber.exe`), the other one (`SJgrabber.exe`) doesn't. I did this to [tackle a limitation in the automated build process](https://github.com/mllrsohn/grunt-node-webkit-builder/issues/78) using [grunt-node-webkit-builder](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-node-webkit-builder).\r\n\r\n### Why develop such a controversial app (genesis)?\r\nI like to make things that are handy and fun to use! Several 'friends of mine' were *sick* of skimming [serienjunkies.org](http://serienjunkies.org/) **each and every day** for new releases of their favourite TV shows. As I have a lot of freetime currently (after graduating from an IT master program in Austria), I decided to develop a tiny app to **assist** them. \r\n\r\nSJgrabber soon became quite polished, hence it was time to publish it and that's it (anyways, feel free to spot evil intentions...).\r\n\r\n### What's the tech behind?\r\nSJgrabber is powered by [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) and distributed as self-contained app for each platform.  \r\nIt's really just HTML/CSS/JS!\r\n\r\n## Support\r\nPlease feel free to donate a beer via bitcoins `1KaeuK2WpwkhK9T3eURK7uxB3frgD8Z4HV`, via <a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=mario%2eranftl%40gmail%2ecom&lc=AT&item_name=a fresh and cold SJgrabber thank you beer&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted\">paypal</a> or via <a href=\"https://www.gittip.com/majodev/\">gittip</a>.  \r\nThank you VERY VERY much!\r\n\r\nI'm also accepting nice words on twitter [@majodev](https://twitter.com/majodev), thx!\r\n\r\n## Bugs, feature requests and disgust\r\nOpen an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/majodev/sjgrabber/issues)!\r\n\r\n## Building\r\n> Only for the brave and nerdy!\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\n* get [node.js](http://nodejs.org/), install it and make yourself comfortable with [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/)\r\n* install [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) globally\r\n* install [bower](http://bower.io/) globally\r\n\r\n### Setup\r\n```bash\r\ngit clone https://github.com/majodev/sjgrabber.git\r\ncd sjgrabber\r\nnpm install -d\r\nbower install -d\r\ngrunt build-static\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debugging\r\nWhile developing it's better to run SJgrabber straight with node-webkit and devtools enabled (the flag `NWAPP_DEBUG` in `package.json` handles setting up a debug environment). Get going by executing `nw .` within your working directory (put the [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) executable into your `PATH`). \r\n\r\n**Important**: SJgrabber reads and saves your data to separate `localStorage` fields during debug-sessions, so developing and enhancing doesn't interfere with your productive use of SJgrabber. Feel free to wipe grabbed releases and favourites as you please.\r\n\r\n### Tasks\r\nIf you plan to make changes to any handlebars template in `/client/templates` or `LICENSE.md` and `README.md`, the `watch` task might become handy, as it automatically executes `build-static` after modifications.\r\n\r\nThe **default** `grunt` task builds, bundles and compresses win32, mac, linux32, linux64 and nw releases into `/dist`. If you have come this far, you'll have the same release-ready builds which I'm distributing here! It executes the following tasks:\r\n* `build` (with 3 essential sub-tasks)\r\n  - `build-static`: template and support file compilation\r\n  - `build-js`: minification (HTML, CSS), uglyfication (JS), dependency retrieval (npm packages without dev-only) and copying `/build-templates`\r\n  - `build-nw`: node-webkit packaging\r\n* `release`: compressing to `/dist` and cleanup\r\n\r\n## Contributors\r\n* [Nicole Eibel](http://nicoleeibel.at/) (SJgrabber brand/logo design)\r\n\r\n## License\r\nSJgrabber is licensed under the MIT License  \r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Mario Ranftl ([@majodev](https://twitter.com/majodev))\r\n\r\nSJgrabber brand/logo is licensed under the [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)  \r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Nicole Eibel ([homepage](http://nicoleeibel.at/))\r\n\r\nSee **LICENSE.md** (or **LICENSE.html** within distributed apps) for more detailed license info and 3rd party licenses.\r\n\r\nSee **credits.html** for [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit) redistributable licenses (platform dependent, this file ONLY ships with SJgrabber binaries).",
